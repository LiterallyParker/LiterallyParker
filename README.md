# â˜» Hey! I'm Parker Townsend. â˜»

I was born in West Texas, where you'll learn the value of hard work very quickly.
I have been coding since 2022, when I first discovered Javascript. Since then, I have been on a very rewarding journey in the tech world.
Some of my projects include **Parker's Poker**, **Instrument Dash**, and this **Chatroom App**.
