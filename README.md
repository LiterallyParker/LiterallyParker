# â˜» Hey! I'm Parker Townsend. â˜»

## I was born in West Texas, where you'll learn the value of hard work very quickly.

## I have been coding since 2022, when I first discovered Javascript. Since then, I have been on a very rewarding journey in the tech world.

### Check out these projects I'm working on:
- **[Parker's Poker](https://github.com/LiterallyParker/Parkers-Poker-V4)**
- **[Instrument Dash](https://github.com/LiterallyParker/Capstone)**
- **[Chatroom App](https://github.com/LiterallyParker/ChatApp)**
