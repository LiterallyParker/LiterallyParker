## 👋 Hi, I’m Parker  
**Software Designer | Full-Stack Developer | ML + Systems Enthusiast**

I build practical, well-architected software. My background spans the PERN stack, Python, C/C++, and Linux systems. I enjoy designing tools, exploring machine learning, and working across the stack—from backend logic to UI polish.

### 🔧 Current Focus
- Developing a detailed **2D Matrix class in Python**
- Improving my User/Auth server capabilities
- Improving systems skills (Linux, tooling, automation)
- Refining workflows with Git and modern dev practices

### 🧠 What I Like Working On
- Web apps (JS, Python, PERN)
- Machine learning experiments  
- Low-level problem solving  
- Databases and data modeling  
- Mobile apps

### 📌 Featured Projects
- **Full-Stack PERN Mock Store** – End-to-end CRUD, auth, and deployment  
- **Raspberry Pi GPIO Modules** – Hardware control utilities in Python  
- **User/Auth Server** – Clean auth flow with JWTs and secure patterns
